Data was sourced from the following Kaggle Link:
https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas/home
The dataset contained over 350K records.  I used Excel to clean the data since 1/3 of it didn't have data populated for columns before a certain date.  I kept only the rows that had pertinent and interesting data that I knew could be queried with minimal NULL values and analyzed to find patterns especially using excel pivot tables and charts.

SQL queries that accomplish the most significant things you know how to do with SQL. These are:
Load data into a database
Select data, including aggregates and using CASE statements, from a database
Retrieve data that meets your conditions by using Where and Having
Combine data from different different tables with inner, outer and full Joins
Combine data with UNION and UNION all
Use nested subqueries
Apply a WITH AS structure to string together subqueries.
Optional: Apply window functions
